              "[' Lower respiratory tract infections are any infections in the lungs or below the voice box. These include pneumonia, bronchitis, and tuberculosis. A lower respiratory tract infection can affect the airways, such as with bronchitis, or the air sacs at the end of the airways, as in the case of pneumonia. In this article, we look at the causes and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections and discuss their treatments and prevention. Symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections vary and depend on the severity of the infection. Less severe infections can have symptoms similar to the common cold, including: In more severe infections, symptoms can include: Lower respiratory tract infections differ from upper respiratory tract infections by the area of the respiratory tract they affect. While lower respiratory tract infections involve the airways below the larynx, upper respiratory tract infections occur in the structures in the larynx or above. People who have lower respiratory tract infections will experience coughing as the primary symptom. People with upper respiratory tract infections will feel the symptoms mainly above the neck, such as sneezing, headaches, and sore throats. They may also experience body aches, especially if they have a fever. Lower respiratory tract infections include: Upper respiratory tract infections include the following: Flu infections can affect both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Infections in the lower respiratory tract are primarily the result of: In some cases, substances from the environment can irritate or cause inflammation in the airways or lungs, which can lead to an infection. These include: Risk factors that make a person more likely to develop a lower respiratory tract infection include: A doctor will usually diagnose a lower respiratory infection during an exam and after discussing the symptoms a person has and how long they have been present. During the exam, the doctor will listen to the person’s chest and breathing through a stethoscope. The doctor may order tests to help diagnose the problem, such as: Some lower respiratory tract infections go away without needing treatment. People can treat these less-severe viral infections at home with: In other cases, a doctor may prescribe additional treatment. This may include antibiotics for bacterial infections, or breathing treatments, such as an inhaler. In some cases, a person may need to visit the hospital to receive IV fluids, antibiotics, or breathing support. Very young children and infants may need more treatment than older children or healthy adults. Doctors often monitor infants especially closely if they have a higher risk of severe infections, such as premature infants or infants with a congenital heart defect. In these cases, a doctor may be more like to recommend hospitalization. Doctors can also recommend similar treatment for people of 65 years of age and above or those individuals with weakened immune systems. Recovery time for a lower respiratory tract infection varies from person to person. According to the American Lung Association, a healthy young adult can recover from a lower respiratory tract infection, such as pneumonia, in around 1 week. For older adults, it may take several weeks to make a full recovery. A person can take many steps to prevent getting a lower respiratory tract infection, including: Most lower respiratory tract infections are uncomplicated. However, when complications occur, they can be very serious. Complications of lower respiratory tract infections can include: Most healthy people make a full recovery from uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections. However, complications can have long-term effects. People who are most at risk for complications include people with other health conditions, adults over 65 years of age and children under 5 years old. These groups can take steps to prevent lower respiratory infections and can consult a doctor if they develop symptoms.

Etiology: Most upper respiratory infections are of viral etiology.\\nEpiglottitis and laryngotracheitis are exceptions with severe cases likely\\ncaused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Bacterial pharyngitis\\nis often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes Table 93-1 Common Agents of Respiratory Infections.  Pathogenesis: Organisms gain entry to the respiratory tract by\\ninhalation of droplets and invade the mucosa. Epithelial destruction may ensue,\\nalong with redness, edema, hemorrhage and sometimes an exudate. Clinical Manifestations: Initial symptoms of a cold are runny,\\nstuffy nose and sneezing, usually without fever. Other upper respiratory\\ninfections may have fever. Children with epiglottitis may have difficulty in\\nbreathing, muffled speech, drooling and stridor. Children with serious\\nlaryngotracheitis (croup) may also have tachypnea, stridor and cyanosis. Microbiologic Diagnosis: Common colds can usually be recognized\\nclinically. Bacterial and viral cultures of throat swab specimens are used for\\npharyngitis, epiglottitis and laryngotracheitis. Blood cultures are also\\nobtained in cases of epiglottitis. Prevention and Treatment: Viral infections are treated\\nsymptomatically. Streptococcal pharyngitis and epiglottitis caused by H\\ninfluenzae are treated with antibacterials. Haemophilus\\ninfluenzae type b vaccine is commercially available and is now a\\nbasic component of childhood immunization program. Etiology: Causative agents of lower respiratory infections are viral\\nor bacterial. Viruses cause most cases of bronchitis and bronchiolitis. In\\ncommunity-acquired pneumonias, the most common bacterial agent is\\nStreptococcus pneumoniae. Atypical pneumonias are cause by\\nsuch agents as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp, Legionella,\\nCoxiella burnetti and viruses. Nosocomial pneumonias and pneumonias\\nin immunosuppressed patients have protean etiology with gram-negative organisms\\nand staphylococci as predominant organisms. Pathogenesis: Organisms enter the distal airway by inhalation,\\naspiration or by hematogenous seeding. The pathogen multiplies in or on the\\nepithelium, causing inflammation, increased mucus secretion, and impaired\\nmucociliary function; other lung functions may also be affected. In severe\\nbronchiolitis, inflammation and necrosis of the epithelium may block small\\nairways leading to airway obstruction. Clinical Manifestations: Symptoms include cough, fever, chest pain,\\ntachypnea and sputum production. Patients with pneumonia may also exhibit\\nnon-respiratory symptoms such as confusion, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain,\\nnausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Microbiologic Diagnosis: Sputum specimens are cultured for bacteria,\\nfungi and viruses. Culture of nasal washings is usually sufficient in infants\\nwith bronchiolitis. Fluorescent staining technic can be used for legionellosis.\\nBlood cultures and/or serologic methods are used for viruses, rickettsiae, fungi\\nand many bacteria. Enzyme-linked immunoassay methods can be used for detections\\nof microbial antigens as well as antibodies. Detection of nucleotide fragments\\nspecific for the microbial antigen in question by DNA probe or polymerase chain\\nreaction can offer a rapid diagnosis. Prevention and Treatment: Symptomatic treatment is used for most\\nviral infections. Bacterial pneumonias are treated with antibacterials. A\\npolysaccharide vaccine against 23 serotypes of Streptococcus\\npneumoniae is recommended for individuals at high risk. Infections of the respiratory tract are grouped according to their symptomatology and\\nanatomic involvement. Acute upper respiratory infections (URI) include the common\\ncold, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, and laryngotracheitis (Fig. 93-1). These infections are usually benign, transitory\\nand self-limited, altho ugh epiglottitis and laryngotracheitis can be serious\\ndiseases in children and young infants. Etiologic agents associated with URI include\\nviruses, bacteria, mycoplasma and fungi (Table\\n93-1). Respiratory infections are more common in the fall and winter when\\nschool starts and indoor crowding facilitates transmission. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections.  Common colds are the most prevalent entity of all respiratory infections and are\\nthe leading cause of patient visits to the physician, as well as work and school\\nabsenteeism. Most colds are caused by viruses. Rhinoviruses with more than 100\\nserotypes are the most common pathogens, causing at least 25% of colds in\\nadults. Coronaviruses may be responsible for more than 10% of cases.\\nParainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses and influenza\\nviruses have all been linked to the common cold syndrome. All of these organisms\\nshow seasonal variations in incidence. The cause of 30% to 40% of cold syndromes\\nhas not been determined. The viruses appear to act through direct invasion of epithelial cells of the\\nrespiratory mucosa (Fig. 93-2), but\\nwhether there is actual destruction and sloughing of these cells or loss of\\nciliary activity depends on the specific organism involved. There is an increase\\nin both leukocyte infiltration and nasal secretions, including large amounts of\\nprotein and immunoglobulin, suggesting that cytokines and immune mechanisms may\\nbe responsible for some of the manifestations of the common cold (Fig. 93-3). Pathogenesis of viral and bacterial mucosal respiratory\\ninfections.  Pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections.  After an incubation period of 48–72 hours, classic symptoms of nasal\\ndischarge and obstruction, sneezing, sore throat and cough occur in both adults\\nand children. Myalgia and headache may also be present. Fever is rare. The\\nduration of symptoms and of viral shedding varies with the pathogen and the age\\nof the patient. Complications are usually rare, but sinusitis and otitis media\\nmay follow. The diagnosis of a common cold is usually based on the symptoms (lack of fever\\ncombined with symptoms of localization to the nasopharynx). Unlike allergic\\nrhinitis, eosinophils are absent in nasal secretions. Although it is possible to\\nisolate the viruses for definitive diagnosis, that is rarely warranted. Treatment of the uncomplicated common cold is generally symptomatic.\\nDecongestants, antipyretics, fluids and bed rest usually suffice. Restriction of\\nactivities to avoid infecting others, along with good hand washing, are the best\\nmeasures to prevent spread of the disease. No vaccine is commercially available\\nfor cold prophylaxis. Sinusitis is an acute inflammatory condition of one or more of the paranasal\\nsinuses. Infection plays an important role in this affliction. Sinusitis often\\nresults from infections of other sites of the respiratory tract since the\\nparanasal sinuses are contiguous to, and communicate with, the upper respiratory\\ntract. Acute sinusitis most often follows a common cold which is usually of viral\\netiology. Vasomotor and allergic rhinitis may also be antecedent to the\\ndevelopment of sinusitis. Obstruction of the sinusal ostia due to deviation of\\nthe nasal septum, presence of foreign bodies, polyps or tumors can predispose to\\nsinusitis. Infection of the maxillary sinuses may follow dental extractions or\\nan extension of infection from the roots of the upper teeth. The most common\\nbacterial agents responsible for acute sinusitis are Streptococcus\\npneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella\\ncatarrhalis. Other organisms including Staphylococcus\\naureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, gram-negative organisms and\\nanaerobes have also been recovered. Chronic sinusitis is commonly a mixed\\ninfection of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Infections caused by viruses or bacteria impair the ciliary activity of the\\nepithelial lining of the sinuses and increased mucous secretions. This leads to\\nobstruction of the paranasal sinusal ostia which impedes drainage. With\\nbacterial multiplication in the sinus cavities, the mucus is converted to\\nmucopurulent exudates. The pus further irritates the mucosal lining causing more\\nedema, epithelial destruction and ostial obstruction. When acute sinusitis is\\nnot resolved and becomes chronic, mucosal thickening results and the development\\nof mucoceles and polyps may ensue. The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are most commonly involved in sinusitis. The\\nfrontal sinuses are less often involved and the sphenoid sinuses are rarely\\naffected. Pain, sensation of pressure and tenderness over the affected sinus are\\npresent. Malaise and low grade fever may also occur. Physical examination\\nusually is not remarkable with no more than an edematous and hyperemic nasal\\nmucosa. In uncomplicated chronic sinusitis, a purulent nasal discharge is the most\\nconstant finding. There may not be pain nor tenderness over the sinus areas.\\nThickening of the sinus mucosa and a fluid level are usually seen in x-ray films\\nor magnetic resonance imaging. For acute sinusitis, the diagnosis is made from clinical findings. A bacterial\\nculture of the nasal discharge can be taken but is not very helpful as the\\nrecovered organisms are generally contaminated by the resident flora from the\\nnasal passage. In chronic sinusitis, a careful dental examination, with sinus\\nx-rays may be required. An antral puncture to obtain sinusal specimens for\\nbacterial culture is needed to establish a specific microbiologic diagnosis. Symptomatic treatment with analgesics and moist heat over the affected sinus pain\\nand a decongestant to promote sinus drainage may suffice. For antimicrobial\\ntherapy, a beta-lactamase resistant antibiotic such as amoxicillin-clavulanate\\nor a cephalosporin may be used. For chronic sinusitis, when conservative\\ntreatment does not lead to a cure, irrigation of the affected sinus may be\\nnecessary. Culture from an antral puncture of the maxillary sinus can be\\nperformed to identify the causative organism for selecting antimicrobial\\ntherapy. Specific preventive procedures are not available. Proper care of\\ninfectious and/or allergic rhinitis, surgical correction to relieve or avoid\\nobstruction of the sinusal ostia are important. Root abscesses of the upper\\nteeth should receive proper dental care to avoid secondary infection of the\\nmaxillary sinuses. Infections of the ears are common events encountered in medical practice,\\nparticularly in young children. Otitis externa is an infection involving the\\nexternal auditory canal while otitis media denotes inflammation of the middle\\near. For otitis externa, the skin flora such as Staphylococcus epidermidis,\\nStaphylococcus aureus, diphtheroids and occasionally an anaerobic\\norganism, Propionibacterium acnes are major etiologic agents.\\nIn a moist and warm environment, a diffuse acute otitis externa (Swimmer's ear)\\nmay be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with other skin\\nflora. Malignant otitis externa is a severe necrotizing infection usually caused\\nby Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For otitis media, the commonest causative bacteria are Streptococcus\\npneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae and beta-lactamase producing\\nMoraxella catarrhalis. Respiratory viruses may play a role\\nin otitis media but this remains uncertain. Mycoplasma\\npneumoniae has been reported to cause hemorrhagic bullous\\nmyringitis in an experimental study among nonimmune human volunteers inoculated\\nwith M pneumoniae. However, in natural cases of M\\npneumoniae infection, clinical bullous myringitis or otitis media\\nis uncommon. The narrow and tortuous auditory canal is lined by a protective surface\\nepithelium. Factors that may disrupt the natural protective mechanisms, such as\\nhigh temperature and humidity, trauma, allergy, tissue maceration, removal of\\ncerumen and an alkaline pH environment, favor the development of otitis externa.\\nProlonged immersion in a swimming pool coupled with frequent ear cleansing\\nincreases the risk of otitis externa. Acute otitis media commonly follows an upper respiratory infection extending from\\nthe nasopharynx via the eustachian tube to the middle ear. Vigorous nose blowing\\nduring a common cold, sudden changes of air pressure, and perforation of the\\ntympanic membrane also favor the development of otitis media. The presence of\\npurulent exudate in the middle ear may lead to a spread of infection to the\\ninner ear and mastoids or even meninges Furuncles of the external ear, similar to those in skin infection, can cause\\nsevere pain and a sense of fullness in the ear canal. When the furuncle\\ndrains, purulent otorrhea may be present. In generalized otitis externa,\\nitching, pain and tenderness of the ear lobe on traction are present. Loss\\nof hearing may be due to obstruction of the ear canal by swelling and the\\npresence of purulent debris. Malignant otitis externa tends to occur in elderly diabetic patients. It is\\ncharacterized by severe persistent earache, foul smelling purulent discharge\\nand the presence of granulation tissue in the auditory canal. The infection\\nmay spread and lead to osteomyelitis of the temporal bone or externally to\\ninvolve the pinna with osteochondritis. Acute otitis media occurs most commonly in young children. The initial\\ncomplaint usually is persistent severe earache (crying in the infant)\\naccompanied by fever, and, and vomiting. Otologic examination reveals a\\nbulging, erythematous tympanic membrane with loss of light reflex and\\nlandmarks. If perforation of the tympanic membrane occurs, serosanguinous or\\npurulent discharge may be present. In the event of an obstruction of the\\neustachian tube, accumulation of a usually sterile effusion in the middle\\near results in serous otitis media. Chronic otitis media frequently presents\\na permanent perforation of the tympanic membrane. A central perforation of\\nthe pars tensa is more benign. On the other hand, an attic perforation of\\nthe pars placcida and marginal perforation of the pars tensa are more\\ndangerous and often associated with a cholesteatoma. The diagnosis of both otitis externa and otitis media can be made from history,\\nclinical symptomatology and physical examinations. Inspection of the tympanic\\nmembrane is an indispensable skill for physicians and health care workers. All\\ndischarge, ear wax and debris must be removed and to perform an adequate\\notoscopy. In the majority of patients, routine cultures are not necessary, as a\\nnumber of good bacteriologic studies have shown consistently the same microbial\\npathogens mentioned in the section of etiology. If the patient is\\nimmunocompromised or is toxic and not responding to initial antimicrobial\\ntherapy tympanocentesis (needle aspiration) to obtain middle ear effusion for\\nmicrobiologic culture is indicated. Topical therapy is usually sufficient and systemic antimicrobials are seldom\\nneeded unless there are signs of spreading cellulitis and the patient\\nappears toxic. A combination of topical antibiotics such as neomycin\\nsulfate, polymyxin B sulfate and corticosteroids used as eardrops, is a\\npreferred therapy. In some cases, acidification of the ear canal by applying\\na 2% solution of acetic acid topically may also be effective. If a furuncle\\nis present in the external canal, the physician should allow it to drain\\nspontaneously. Amoxicillin is an effective and preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute\\notitis media. Since beta-lactamase producing H influenzae\\nand M catarrhalis can be a problem in some communities,\\namoxicillin-clavulanate is used by many physicians. Oral preparations of\\ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, second and third generation cephalosporins,\\ntetracyclines and macrolides can also be used. When there is a large\\neffusion, tympanocentesis may hasten the resolution process by decreasing\\nthe sterile effusion. Patients with chronic otitis media and frequent\\nrecurrences of middle ear infections may be benefitted by chemoprophylaxis\\nwith once daily oral amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole during the\\nwinter and spring months. In those patients with persistent effusion of the\\nmiddle ear, surgical interventions with myringotomy, adenoidectomy and the\\nplacement of tympanotomy tubes has been helpful. Use of polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines has been evaluated for the prevention\\nof otitis media in children. However, children under two years of age do not\\nrespond satisfactorily to polysaccharide antigens; further, no significant\\nreduction in the number of middle ear infections was demonstrable. Newer\\nvaccines composed of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides conjugated to\\nproteins may increase the immunogenicity and are currently under clinical\\ninvestigation for efficacy and safety. Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx involving lymphoid tissues of the\\nposterior pharynx and lateral pharyngeal bands. The etiology can be bacterial,\\nviral and fungal infections as well as noninfectious etiologies such as smoking.\\nMost cases are due to viral infections and accompany a common cold or influenza.\\nType A coxsackieviruses can cause a severe ulcerative pharyngitis in children\\n(herpangina), and adenovirus and herpes simplex virus, although less common,\\nalso can cause severe pharyngitis. Pharyngitis is a common symptom of\\nEpstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus or Streptococcus pyogenes\\nis the most important bacterial agent associated with acute pharyngitis and\\ntonsillitis. Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes occasional\\ncases of acute pharyngitis, as do mixed anaerobic infections (Vincent's angina),\\nCorynebacterium haemolyticum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and\\nChlamydia trachomatis. Outbreaks of Chlamydia\\npneumoniae (TWAR agent) causing pharyngitis or pneumonitis have\\noccurred in military recruits. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and\\nMycoplasma hominis have been associated with acute\\npharyngitis. Candida albicans, which causes oral candidiasis or\\nthrush, can involve the pharynx, leading to inflammation and pain. As with common cold, viral pathogens in pharyngitis appear to invade the mucosal\\ncells of the nasopharynx and oral cavity, resulting in edema and hyperemia of\\nthe mucous membranes and tonsils (Fig\\n93-2). Bacteria attach to and, in the case of group A beta-hemolytic\\nstreptococci, invade the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. Many clinical\\nmanifestations of infection appear to be due to the immune reaction to products\\nof the bacterial cell. In diphtheria, a potent bacterial exotoxin causes local\\ninflammation and cell necrosis. Pharyngitis usually presents with a red, sore, or “scratchy”\\nthroat. An inflammatory exudate or membranes may cover the tonsils and tonsillar\\npillars. Vesicles or ulcers may also be seen on the pharyngeal walls. Depending\\non the pathogen, fever and systemic manifestations such as malaise, myalgia, or\\nheadache may be present. Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy is common in\\nbacterial pharyngitis and difficulty in swallowing may be present. The goal in the diagnosis of pharyngitis is to identify cases that are due to\\ngroup A beta-hemolytic streptococci, as well as the more unusual and potentially\\nserious infections. The various forms of pharyngitis cannot be distinguished on\\nclinical grounds. Routine throat cultures for bacteria are inoculated onto sheep\\nblood and chocolate agar plates. Thayer-Martin medium is used if N\\ngonorrhoeae is suspected. Viral cultures are not routinely obtained\\nfor most cases of pharyngitis. Serologic studies may be used to confirm the\\ndiagnosis of pharyngitis due to viral, mycoplasmal or chlamydial pathogens.\\nRapid diagnostic tests with fluorescent antibody or latex agglutination to\\nidentify group A streptococci from pharyngeal swabs are available. Gene probe\\nand polymerase chain reaction can be used to detect unusual organisms such as\\nM pneumoniae, chlamydia or viruses but these procedures are\\nnot routine diagnostic methods. Symptomatic treatment is recommended for viral pharyngitis. The exception is\\nherpes simplex virus infection, which can be treated with acyclovir if\\nclinically warranted or if diagnosed in immunocompromised patients. The specific\\nantibacterial agents will depend on the causative organism, but penicillin G is\\nthe therapy of choice for streptococcal pharyngitis. Mycoplasma and chlamydial\\ninfections respond to erythromycin, tetracyclines and the new macrolides. Inflammation of the upper airway is classified as epiglottitis or\\nlaryngotracheitis (croup) on the basis of the location, clinical manifestations,\\nand pathogens of the infection. Haemophilus influenzae type b\\nis the most common cause of epiglottitis, particularly in children age 2 to 5\\nyears. Epiglottitis is less common in adults. Some cases of epiglottitis in\\nadults may be of viral origin. Most cases of laryngotracheitis are due to\\nviruses. More serious bacterial infections have been associated with H\\ninfluenzae type b, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and\\nC diphtheriae. Parainfluenza viruses are most common but\\nrespiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, enteroviruses and\\nMycoplasma pneumoniae have been implicated. A viral upper respiratory infection may precede infection with H\\ninfluenzae in episodes of epiglottitis. However, once H\\ninfluenzae type b infection starts, rapidly progressive erythema\\nand swelling of the epiglottis ensue, and bacteremia is usually present. Viral\\ninfection of laryngotracheitis commonly begins in the nasopharynx and eventually\\nmoves into the larynx and trachea. Inflammation and edema involve the\\nepithelium, mucosa and submucosa of the subglottis which can lead to airway\\nobstruction. The syndrome of epiglottitis begins with the acute onset of fever, sore throat,\\nhoarseness, drooling, dysphagia and progresses within a few hours to severe\\nrespiratory distress and prostration. The clinical course can be fulminant and\\nfatal. The pharynx may be inflamed, but the diagnostic finding is a\\n“cherry-red” epiglottis. A history of preceding cold-like symptoms is typical of laryngotracheitis, with\\nrhinorrhea, fever, sore throat and a mild cough. Tachypnea, a deep barking cough\\nand inspiratory stridor eventually develop. Children with bacterial tracheitis\\nappear more ill than adults and are at greater risk of developing airway\\nobstruction. Haemophilus influenzae type b is isolated from the blood or\\nepiglottis in the majority of patients with epiglottis; therefore a blood\\nculture should always be performed. Sputum cultures or cultures from pharyngeal\\nswabs may be used to isolate pathogens in patients with laryngotracheitis.\\nSerologic studies to detect a rise in antibody titers to various viruses are\\nhelpful for retrospective diagnosis. Newer, rapid diagnostic techniques, using\\nimmunofluorescent-antibody staining to detect virus in sputum, pharyngeal swabs,\\nor nasal washings, have been successfully used. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent\\nassay (ELISA), DNA probe and polymerase chain reaction procedures for detection\\nof viral antibody or antigens are now available for rapid diagnosis. Epiglottitis is a medical emergency, especially in children. All children with\\nthis diagnosis should be observed carefully and be intubated to maintain an open\\nairway as soon as the first sign of respiratory distress is detected.\\nAntibacterial therapy should be directed at H influenzae.\\nPatients with croup are usually successfully managed with close observation and\\nsupportive care, such as fluid, humidified air, and racemic epinephrine. For\\nprevention, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugated vaccine is\\nrecommended for all pediatric patients, as is immunization against\\ndiphtheria. Infections of the lower respiratory tract include bronchitis, bronchiolitis and\\npneumonia (Fig 93-1). These syndromes,\\nespecially pneumonia, can be severe or fatal. Although viruses, mycoplasma,\\nrickettsiae and fungi can all cause lower respiratory tract infections, bacteria\\nare the dominant pathogens; accounting for a much higher percentage of lower\\nthan of upper respiratory tract infections. Bronchitis and bronchiolitis involve inflammation of the bronchial tree.\\nBronchitis is usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection or forms\\npart of a clinical syndrome in diseases such as influenza, rubeola, rubella,\\npertussis, scarlet fever and typhoid fever. Chronic bronchitis with a persistent\\ncough and sputum production appears to be caused by a combination of\\nenvironmental factors, such as smoking, and bacterial infection with pathogens\\nsuch as H influenzae and S pneumoniae.\\nBronchiolitis is a viral respiratory disease of infants and is caused primarily\\nby respiratory syncytial virus. Other viruses, including parainfluenza viruses,\\ninfluenza viruses and adenoviruses (as well as occasionally M\\npneumoniae) are also known to cause bronchiolitis. When the bronchial tree is infected, the mucosa becomes hyperemic and edematous\\nand produces copious bronchial secretions. The damage to the mucosa can range\\nfrom simple loss of mucociliary function to actual destruction of the\\nrespiratory epithelium, depending on the organisms(s) involved. Patients with\\nchronic bronchitis have an increase in the number of mucus-producing cells in\\ntheir airways, as well as inflammation and loss of bronchial epithelium, Infants\\nwith bronchiolitis initially have inflammation and sometimes necrosis of the\\nrespiratory epithelium, with eventual sloughing. Bronchial and bronchiolar walls\\nare thickened. Exudate made up of necrotic material and respiratory secretions\\nand the narrowing of the bronchial lumen lead to airway obstruction. Areas of\\nair trapping and atelectasis develop and may eventually contribute to\\nrespiratory failure. Symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection with a cough is the typical\\ninitial presentation in acute bronchitis. Mucopurulent sputum may be present,\\nand moderate temperature elevations occur. Typical findings in chronic\\nbronchitis are an incessant cough and production of large amounts of sputum,\\nparticularly in the morning. Development of respiratory infections can lead to\\nacute exacerbations of symptoms with possibly severe respiratory distress. Coryza and cough usually precede the onset of bronchiolitis. Fever is common. A\\ndeepening cough, increased respiratory rate, and restlessness follow.\\nRetractions of the chest wall, nasal flaring, and grunting are prominent\\nfindings. Wheezing or an actual lack of breath sounds may be noted. Respiratory\\nfailure and death may result. Bacteriologic examination and culture of purulent respiratory secretions should\\nalways be performed for cases of acute bronchitis not associated with a common\\ncold. Patients with chronic bronchitis should have their sputum cultured for\\nbacteria initially and during exacerbations. Aspirations of nasopharyngeal\\nsecretions or swabs are sufficient to obtain specimens for viral culture in\\ninfants with bronchiolitis. Serologic tests demonstrating a rise in antibody\\ntiter to specific viruses can also be performed. Rapid diagnostic tests for\\nantibody or viral antigens may be performed on nasopharyngeal secretions by\\nusing fluorescent-antibody staining, ELISA or DNA probe procedures. With only a few exceptions, viral infections are treated with supportive\\nmeasures. Respiratory syncytial virus infections in infants may be treated with\\nribavirin. Amantadine and rimantadine are available for chemoprophylaxis or\\ntreatment of influenza type A viruses. Selected groups of patients with chronic\\nbronchitis may receive benefit from use of corticosteroids, bronchodilators, or\\nprophylactic antibiotics. Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung parenchyma (Fig 93-4). Consolidation of the lung tissue may be\\nidentified by physical examination and chest x-ray. From an anatomical point of\\nview, lobar pneumonia denotes an alveolar process involving an entire lobe of\\nthe lung while bronchopneumonia describes an alveolar process occurring in a\\ndistribution that is patchy without filling an entire lobe. Numerous factors,\\nincluding environmental contaminants and autoimmune diseases, as well as\\ninfection, may cause pneumonia. The various infectious agents that cause\\npneumonia are categorized in many ways for purposes of laboratory testing,\\nepidemiologic study and choice of therapy. Pneumonias occurring in usually\\nhealthy persons not confined to an institution are classified as\\ncommunity-acquired pneumonias. Infections arise while a patient is hospitalized\\nor living in an institution such as a nursing home are called hospital-acquired\\nor nosocomial pneumonias. Etiologic pathogens associated with community-acquired\\nand hospital-acquired pneumonias are somewhat different. However, many organisms\\ncan cause both types of infections. Pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonias.  Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common agent of\\ncommunity-acquired acute bacterial pneumonia. More than 80 serotypes, as\\ndetermined by capsular polysaccharides, are known, but 23 serotypes account\\nfor over 90% of all pneumococcal pneumonias in the United States. Pneumonias\\ncaused by other streptococci are uncommon. Streptococcus\\npyogenes pneumonia is often associated with a hemorrhagic\\npneumonitis and empyema. Community-acquired pneumonias caused by\\nStaphylococcus aureus are also uncommon and usually\\noccur after influenza or from staphylococcal bacteremia. Infections due to\\nHaemophilus influenzae (usually nontypable) and\\nKlebsiella pneumoniae are more common among patients\\nover 50 years old who have chronic obstructive lung disease or\\nalcoholism. The most common agents of nosocomial pneumonias are aerobic gram-negative\\nbacilli that rarely cause pneumonia in healthy individuals.\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter,\\nProteus, and Klebsiella species are often\\nidentified. Less common agents causing pneumonias include\\nFrancisella tularensis, the agent of tularemia;\\nYersinia pestis, the agent of plague; and\\nNeisseria meningitidis, which usually causes meningitis\\nbut can be associated with pneumonia, especially among military recruits.\\nXanthomonas pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a chronic\\npneumonia in Southeast Asia. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can cause pneumonia. Although the\\nincidence of tuberculosis is low in industrialized countries, M\\ntuberculosis infections still continue to be a significant\\npublic health problem in the United States, particularly among immigrants\\nfrom developing countries, intravenous drug abusers, patients infected with\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the institutionalized elderly.\\nAtypical Mycobacterium species can cause lung disease\\nindistinguishable from tuberculosis. Aspiration pneumonia from anaerobic organisms usually occurs in patients with\\nperiodontal disease or depressed consciousness. The bacteria involved are\\nusually part the oral flora and cultures generally show a mixed bacterial\\ngrowth. Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Veilonella,\\nPropionibacterium, Eubacterium, and\\nFusobacterium spp are often isolated. Atypical pneumonias are those that are not typical bacterial lobar\\npneumonias. Mycoplasma pneumoniae produces pneumonia most\\ncommonly in young people between 5 and 19 years of age. Outbreaks have been\\nreported among military recruits and college students. Legionella species, including L pneumophila, can cause a\\nwide range of clinical manifestations. The 1976 outbreak in Philadelphia was\\nmanifested as a typical serious pneumonia in affected individuals, with a\\nmortality of 17% (see Ch. 40).\\nThese organisms can survive in water and cause pneumonia by inhalation from\\naerosolized tap water, respiratory devices, air conditioners and showers.\\nThey also have been reported to cause nosocomial pneumonias. Chlamydia spp noted to cause pneumonitis are C\\ntrachomatis, C psittaci and C pneumoniae.\\nChlamydia trachomatis causes pneumonia in neonates and\\nyoung infants. C psittaci is a known cause for occupational\\npneumonitis in bird handlers such as turkey farmers. Chlamydia\\npneumoniae has been associated with outbreaks of pneumonia in\\nmilitary recruits and on college campuses. Coxiella burnetii the rickettsia responsible for Q fever, is\\nacquired by inhalation of aerosols from infected animal placentas and feces.\\nPneumonitis is one of the major manifestations of this systemic\\ninfection. Viral pneumonias are rare in healthy civilian adults. An exception is the\\nviral pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, which can have a high mortality\\nin the elderly and in patients with underlying disease. A serious\\ncomplication following influenza virus infection is a secondary bacterial\\npneumonia, particularly staphylococcal pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial\\nvirus can cause serious pneumonia among infants as well as outbreaks among\\ninstitutionalized adults. Adenoviruses may also cause pneumonia, serotypes\\n1,2,3,7 and 7a have been associated with a severe, fatal pneumonia in\\ninfants. Although varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis is rare in children, it\\nis not uncommon in individuals over 19 years old. Morality can be as high as\\n10% to 30%. Measles pneumonia may occur in adults. Cytomegalovirus is well known for causing congenital infections in neonates,\\nas well as the mononucleosis-like illness seen in adults. However, among its\\nmanifestations in immunocompromised individuals is a severe and often fatal\\npneumonitis. Herpes simplex virus also causes a pneumonia in this\\npopulation. Giant-cell pneumonia is a serious complication of measles and\\nhas been found in children with immunodeficiency disorders or underlying\\ncancers who receive live attenuated measles vaccine.\\nActinomyces and Nocardia spp can cause\\npneumonitis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Among the fungi, Cryptococcus neoformans and\\nSporothrix schenckii are found worldwide, whereas\\nBlastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma\\ncapsulatum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis\\nhave specific geographic distributions. All can cause pneumonias, which are\\nusually chronic and possible clinically inapparent in normal hosts, but are\\nmanifested as more serious diseases in immunocompromised patients. Other\\nfungi, such as Aspergillus and Candida\\nspp, occasionally are responsible for pneumonias in severely ill or\\nimmunosuppressed patients and neonates. Pneumocystis carinii produces a life-threatening pneumonia\\namong patients immunosuppressed by acquired immune deficiency syndrome\\n(AIDS), hematologic cancers, or medical therapy. It is the most common cause\\nof pneumonia among patients with AIDS when the CD4 cell counts drop below\\n200/mm3. Infectious agents gain access to the lower respiratory tract by the inhalation of\\naerosolized material, by aspiration of upper airway flora, or by hematogenous\\nseeding. Pneumonia occurs when lung defense mechanisms are diminished or\\noverwhelmed. The major symptoms or pneumonia are cough, chest pain, fever,\\nshortness of breath and sputum production. Patients are tachycardic. Headache,\\nconfusion, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may be present,\\ndepending on the age of the patient and the organisms involved. Etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia on clinical grounds alone is almost impossible.\\nSputum should be examined for a predominant organism in any patient suspected to\\nhave a bacterial pneumonia; blood and pleural fluid (if present) should be\\ncultured. A sputum specimen with fewer than 10 while cells per high-power field\\nunder a microscope is considered to be contaminated with oral secretions and is\\nunsatisfactory for diagnosis. Acid-fast stains and cultures are used to identify\\nMycobacterium and Nocardia spp. Most\\nfungal pneumonias are diagnosed on the basis of culture of sputum or lung\\ntissue. Viral infection may be diagnosed by demonstration of antigen in\\nsecretions or cultures or by an antibody response. Serologic studies can be used\\nto identify viruses, M pneumoniae, C. burnetii, Chlamydia species,\\nLegionella, Francisella, and Yersinia. A rise in\\nserum cold agglutinins may be associated with M pneumoniae\\ninfection, but the test is positive in only about 60% of patients with this\\npathogen. Rapid diagnostic tests, as described in previous sections, are available to\\nidentify respiratory viruses: the fluorescent-antibody test is used for\\nLegionella. A sputum quellung test can specify S\\npneumoniae by serotype. Enzyme-linked immunoassay, DNA probe and\\npolymerase chain reaction methods are available for many agents causing\\nrespiratory infections. Some organisms that may colonize the respiratory tract are considered to be\\npathogens only when they are shown to be invading the parenchyma. Diagnosis of\\npneumonia due to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus,\\nAspergillus spp. or Candida spp require\\nspecimens obtained by transbronchial or open-lung biopsy. Pneumocystis\\ncarinii can be found by silver stain of expectorated sputum.\\nHowever, if the sputum is negative, deeper specimens from the lower respiratory\\ntract obtained by bronchoscopy or by lung biopsy are needed for confirmatory\\ndiagnosis. Until the organism causing the infection is identified, decisions on therapy are\\nbased upon clinical history, including history of exposure, age, underlying\\ndisease and previous therapies, past pneumonias, geographic location, severity\\nof illness, clinical symptoms, and sputum examination. Once a diagnosis is made,\\ntherapy is directed at the specific organism responsible. The pneumococcal vaccine should be given to patients at high risk for developing\\npneumococcal infections, including asplenic patients, the elderly and any\\npatients immunocompromised through disease or medical therapy. Yearly influenza\\nvaccinations should also be provided for these particular groups. An\\nenteric-coated vaccine prepared from certain serotypes of adenoviruses is\\navailable, but is only used in military recruits. In AIDS patients,\\ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, aerosolized pentamidine or other antimicrobials\\ncan be given for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii\\ninfections.

              " ' Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a term often used as a synonym for pneumonia but can also be applied to other types of infection including lung abscess and acute bronchitis. Symptoms include shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and fatigue.[3] A routine chest X-ray is not always necessary for people who have symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection.[4]\\n Influenza affects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.[citation needed]\\n Antibiotics are the first line treatment for pneumonia; however, they are neither effective nor indicated for parasitic or viral infections. Acute bronchitis typically resolves on its own with time.[citation needed]\\n In 2015 there were about 291 million cases.[1] These resulted in 2.74 million deaths down from 3.4 million deaths in 1990.[5][2] This was 4.8% of all deaths in 2013.[5]\\n Bronchitis describes the swelling or inflammation of the[6] bronchial tubes. Additionally, bronchitis is described as either acute or chronic depending on its presentation and is also further described by the causative agent. Acute bronchitis can be defined as acute bacterial or viral infection of the larger airways in healthy patients with no history of recurrent disease.[7] It affects over 40 adults per 1000 each year and consists of transient inflammation of the major bronchi and trachea.[8] Most often it is caused by viral infection and hence antibiotic therapy is not indicated in immunocompetent individuals.[9][6] Viral bronchitis can sometimes be treated using antiviral medications depending on the virus causing the infection, and medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs and expectorants can help mitigate the symptoms.[10][6] Treatment of acute bronchitis with antibiotics is common but controversial as their use has only moderate benefit weighted against potential side effects (nausea and vomiting), increased resistance, and cost of treatment in a self-limiting condition.[8][11] Beta2 agonists are sometimes used to relieve the cough associated with acute bronchitis. In a recent systematic review it was found there was no evidence to support their use.[6]\\n Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) are frequently due to non-infective causes along with viral ones.  50% of patients are colonised with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.[7]  Antibiotics have only been shown to be effective if all three of the following symptoms are present: increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and purulence.  In these cases, 500\\xa0mg of amoxicillin orally, every 8 hours for 5 days or 100\\xa0mg doxycycline orally for 5 days should be used.[7]\\n Pneumonia occurs in a variety of situations and treatment must vary according to the situation.[10] It is classified as either community or hospital acquired depending on where the patient contracted the infection. It is life-threatening in the elderly or those who are immunocompromised.[12][13] The most common treatment is antibiotics and these vary in their adverse effects and their effectiveness.[12][14] Pneumonia is also the leading cause of death in children less than five years of age in low income countries.[14] The most common cause of pneumonia is pneumococcal bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for 2/3 of bacteremic pneumonias.[15] This is a dangerous type of lung infection with a mortality rate of around 25%.[13]\\nFor optimal management of a pneumonia patient, the following must be assessed: pneumonia severity (including treatment location, e.g., home, hospital or intensive care), identification of causative organism, analgesia of chest pain, the need for supplemental oxygen, physiotherapy, hydration, bronchodilators and possible complications of emphysema or lung abscess.[16]\\n Typical bacterial Infections:\\n Atypical bacterial Infections:\\n Parasitic infections:\\n Viral infections:\\n Aspiration pneumonia\\n Vaccination helps prevent bronchopneumonia, mostly against influenza viruses, adenoviruses, measles, rubella, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, diphtheria, bacillus anthracis, chickenpox, and bordetella pertussis.[18] Specifically for the children with low serum retinol or who are suffering from malnutrition, vitamin A supplements are recommended as a preventive measure against acute LRTI.[19]\\n Antibiotics do not help the many lower respiratory infections which are caused by parasites or viruses. While acute bronchitis often does not require antibiotic therapy, antibiotics can be given to patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.[20] The indications for treatment are increased dyspnoea, and an increase in the volume or purulence of the sputum.[21] The treatment of bacterial pneumonia is selected by considering the age of the patient, the severity of the illness and the presence of underlying disease. A systematic review of 32 randomised controlled trials with 6,078 participants with acute respiratory infections compared procalcitonin (a blood marker for bacterial infections) to guide the initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment, against no use of procalcitonin. Among 3,336 people receiving procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy, there were 236 deaths, compared to 336 deaths out 3,372 participants who did not. Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy also reduced the antibiotic use duration by 2.4 days, and there were fewer antibiotic side effects. This means that procalcitonin is useful for guiding whether to use antibiotics for acute respiratory infections and the duration of the antibiotic.[22] Amoxicillin and doxycycline are suitable for many of the lower respiratory tract infections seen in general practice.[20] Another cochrane review suggests that new studies are needed to confirm that azithromycin may lead to less treatment failure and lower side effects than amoxycillin.[23] In the other hand, there is no sufficient evidence to consider the antibiotics as a prophylaxis for the high risk children under 12 years.[24]\\n Oxygen supplementation is often recommended for people with severe lower respiratory tract infections.[25] Oxygen can be provided in a non-invasive manner using nasal prongs, face masks, a head box or hood, a nasal catheter, or a nasopharyngeal catheter.[25] For children younger than 15 years old, nasopharyngel catheters or nasal prongs are recommended over a face mask or head box.[25] A Cochrane review in 2014 presented a summary to identify children complaining of severe LRTI, however; further research is required to determine the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen and the best delivery method.[25]\\n Lower respiratory infectious disease is the fifth-leading cause of death and the combined leading infectious cause of death, being responsible for 2.74 million deaths worldwide.[26] This is generally similar to estimates in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study.[27]\\nThis total only accounts for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus Influenzae infections and does not account for atypical or nosocomial causes of lower respiratory disease, therefore underestimating total disease burden.[citation needed]\\n Lower respiratory tract infections place a considerable strain on the health budget and are generally more serious than upper respiratory infections.[citation needed]\\n Workplace burdens arise from the acquisition of a lower respiratory tract infection, with factors such as total per person expenditures and total medical service utilisation demonstrated as greater among individuals experiencing a lower respiratory tract infection.[28]\\n Pan-national data collection indicates that childhood nutrition plays a significant role in determining the acquisition of a lower respiratory tract infection, with the promotion of the implementation of nutrition program, and policy guidelines in affected countries.[26]\\n',\n",

Content Table Content Table Acute lower respiratory infections include pneumonia (infection of the lung alveoli), as well as infections affecting the airways such as acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, influenza and whooping cough. They are a leading cause of illness and death in children and adults across the world. The importance of lower respiratory infections may be underestimated. Acute bronchitis is a short-term infection of the airways. Bronchiolitis is an infection of the lower airways affecting babies and infants under 2 years of age. It is the most common cause of admission to hospital for babies under the age of 1 year. Influenza occurs in annual epidemics and occasionally pandemics, where the outbreak covers an even larger geographical area. The most serious forms of this infection are seen in people over the age of 65 years, children under the age of 2 years and people of any age with certain existing medical conditions. There are several underlying conditions that could increase the risk of hospitalisation from influenza. These include diabetes and heart, lung and neurological diseases, including asthma. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung, the most frequent cause of death due to infection in Europe and the USA. It causes symptoms for 3-4 weeks and is more common in very young children and elderly adults. There are three types of pneumonia: The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough that cannot be explained by an existing long-term lung condition. Bronchiolitis causes babies and infants to have prolonged symptoms of wheeze and cough, lasting for weeks and months after the first symptoms. The usual form of influenza can result in symptoms of fever, muscle pain, headache, cough, sore throat and a blocked nose. If the infection is more severe it can lead to pneumonia. People with pneumonia experience a cough along with other symptoms such as fever or breathlessness without an obvious cause. Infections are caused by tiny organisms, known as bacteria or viruses. There are millions of organisms that surround us. Viruses are carried in tiny droplets and are passed between people when someone with the virus coughs or sneezes. People who are infected produce antibodies to fight the virus. Once they have fought off this strain, they will be able to fight it if infected again. However, over time, the virus can change into different forms, which means the body may not have the right antibodies to fight it again. Almost 90% of cases of acute bronchitis are related to viruses such as influenza and the rhinovirus. Less than 10% are linked with bacteria. Bronchiolitis is most often caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and babies. There are three influenza viruses A, B and C. A has the biggest impact, B causes less severe illness and C does not cause any illness in humans. When a new strain develops that people have no resistance to, it can spread across the world. This was the case during the ‘swine flu’ outbreak in 2009. The most common cause of pneumonia in adults is a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumonia. Viruses can also cause pneumonia, most commonly the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in small children, and sometimes influenza. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is caused by germs in a hospital, whereas community-acquired pneumonia is caused by different germs in the community. The best way to prevent infections is via vaccinations. Vaccination against pneumonia and influenza is commonly given to groups, such as the elderly or very young, who are most at risk. One way to treat in an infection is through drugs known as antibiotics. Antibiotics should only be prescribed when necessary or antibiotic resistance can develop. Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria is regularly exposed to the same drug over time and will eventually mutate and develop resistance to this drug. Using antibiotics to treat mild illnesses unnecessarily speeds up the problem of antibiotic resistance, than if the drugs were only used in severe cases. People who suspect they have bronchitis do not need to visit a doctor for a diagnosis, unless they have severe or persistent symptoms. Most cases of acute bronchitis do not require drugs to treat the condition and the symptoms can be managed at home by getting rest and drinking fluids. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses so are not prescribed to treat acute bronchitis. Bronchiolitis is diagnosed by monitoring the symptoms and analysing a child’s breathing. Babies infected with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) usually require supportive care but no medication. In extremely severe cases, they are given antiviral drugs. People who are fit and healthy do not need to visit a doctor to diagnose flu. It is usually possible to treat the symptoms of influenza at home with rest and drinking plenty of water. Antiviral drugs are also used to treat influenza in people who are at risk of other complications. A doctor will diagnose flu based on symptoms and medical history if a person is at risk. An x-ray can be used to check for pneumonia and is likely to show shadowing on the lungs if the infection is present. Antibiotics are used to treat pneumonia and different approaches should be used according to the risk of the person and severity of the illness.

              " \" Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI) are infections that affect the airways (below the level of the larynx), including the trachea and the alveolar sacs. LRTI are characterized in many different ways. Acute infections that affect the airways include acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis and influenza, whereas acute infections that affect the alveolar sacs can include pneumonia. Infections are caused by tiny organisms known as bacteria or viruses, which are usually the most common cause. They are carried in tiny droplets and passed between people by coughing, sneezing and at times by indirect contact with surfaces. People who are infected usually produce antibodies to fight the virus. If re-infected, the antibodies help to fight the infection with the same strain. Viruses can change forms and manifest in different strains, causing the body to produce new antibodies. Less frequently, these bacteria can go on to cause a LRTI.

Learn more about managing cookies.  If you set your home or work addresses, they may be used to estimate your location when it’s likely that you’re at one of these places. You can edit or delete your home or work addresses in Google Maps. If the location of your labeled places was used to help get your search results, the location information at the bottom of the search results page will say Based on\\xa0your places (Home) or (Work). If you’re signed in to your Google Account and have Web & App Activity turned on, your activity on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your Google Account. Some items from your activity may include the general area you were in at the time. A precise location can be stored in your activity if your activity involves a precise location. In some cases, areas that you have searched for in the past may be used to estimate your current location. For example, if you search for coffee shops in Chelsea and then nail salon, Google might show nail salons in Chelsea. You can view and control your Web & App Activity, at myactivity.google.com. Learn how to view & control activity on your account. If you’re not signed in to your Google Account, Google may store some location information for previous searches from the device you’re using to help provide more relevant results and recommendations. If you turn off\\xa0Search customization\\xa0,\\xa0Google won\\'t use previous searches to estimate your location. Learn more about how to search and browse privately. If your previous activity was used to help get your search results, the location information at the bottom of the search results page will say \"Based on your past activity.\" An IP address, also called Internet address,\\xa0is assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider. It\\'s a requirement to use the internet. IP addresses are used to make the connection between your device and the websites and services you use. IP addresses are roughly based on geography. This means that any website you use, including google.com, may get some information about your general area. If your IP address was used to estimate your current general area for your search, the location information at the bottom of the search results page will say From your internet address. Important: The Internet doesn\\'t work without IP addresses. When you use sites, apps, or services like Google, they can usually detect some information about your location. When you search on Google, Google will always estimate the general area that you’re searching from. Estimating the general area that you’re in means\\xa0that Google can give you relevant results, and keep your account safe by detecting unusual activity, such as signing in from a new city. A general area is larger than 1 sq mi, and has at least 1000 users so that the general area of your search does not identify you, helping to protect your privacy. This means that a general area is typically much larger than 1 sq mi outside of cities. The estimated general area comes from the location sources described in this article. If you grant location permissions to google.com or Google apps on your device, then when you search, your precise location will be used by Google to show you the best search results. Precise location means exactly where you are, such as a particular address. If you set your home or work addresses, and Google estimates that you’re at home or work, then the exact address will be used for your search.']"
